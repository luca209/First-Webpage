        <p>My Name is Luca Lelie, I am twenty-four years old and I am studying in a masterâ€™s degree program in electrical technologies at the University of Applied Sciences in Kiel.
            In my Bachelor studies, which I finished last year, I learned the basics of C++, algorithms and data structures. Now I am really curious how front end development works and I think it is cool, that web development combines programming and designing things. I like that you can directly see the result of your code on a web surface and have the opportunity to be creative.
            I already taught myself the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and tried to code some simple websites, but it would be nice to learn these things in a professional course and make contacts to potential employers.
        </p>
        <p>In summer, besides my studies, I usually work as a wind- and kitesurfing instructor. Therefore, I would love having the possibility to be independent of where or when I work. 
            Therefore I am very interested to learn more about front end development.
